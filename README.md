## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm, pnpm, or yarn
- GitHub Copilot subscription and CLI configured (required for AI functionality)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sekka1/Moss-chat-web.git
cd Moss-chat-web
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Copilot

Ensure you have GitHub Copilot CLI installed and authenticated:

```bash
# Login to GitHub Copilot (if not already logged in)
gh copilot login
```

Note: The application requires an active GitHub Copilot subscription. If Copilot is not available, the application will provide fallback responses with knowledge base context.

## Development

### Run in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the server using `ts-node` in development mode.

### Build the application

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles TypeScript files from `src/` to JavaScript in `dist/`.

### Run in production mode

```bash
npm start
```

This runs the compiled JavaScript from the `dist/` folder.

### Lint the code

```bash
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Run tests

Run the automated unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

The unit tests use mocks and don't require GitHub Copilot authentication. They verify:
- Copilot service initialization and shutdown
- Response handling for "what is a live moss wall?" query
- Context-aware responses with knowledge base integration
- Streaming functionality

#### Integration Testing with Real Copilot

To test with the actual GitHub Copilot SDK (requires authentication):

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

**Requirements for integration testing:**
- Active GitHub Copilot subscription
- GitHub CLI authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- GitHub Copilot configured (`gh copilot login`)

The integration test will:
1. Ask "what is a live moss wall?" to the real Copilot SDK
2. Verify a valid response is received
3. Display the response for manual verification

**Additional test commands:**
```bash
npm run test:watch     # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage  # Generate test coverage report
```

## Application Usage

1. Start the server using one of the methods above
2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
3. You'll see the Moss Chat interface with:
   - **Top area**: Displays AI responses and chat history
   - **Bottom area**: Input box for typing questions
4. Type a question and press Enter or click Send
5. The application will use GitHub Copilot SDK to generate intelligent responses, enhanced with relevant information from the knowledge base

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/chat

Send a message to the AI assistant and receive a complete response.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "Your question here"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "AI response generated by GitHub Copilot SDK"
}
```

### POST /api/chat/stream

Send a message and receive a streaming response via Server-Sent Events (SSE).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "Your question here"
}
```

**Response:** Server-Sent Events stream with chunks:
```
data: {"chunk":"AI response chunk"}

data: {"chunk":"more response..."}

data: [DONE]
```

### GET /api/health

Health check endpoint to verify the server is running.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

## GitHub Copilot SDK Integration

This application uses the [GitHub Copilot SDK](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk) to provide intelligent AI responses. The integration includes:

- **Semantic Document Ranking**: Uses GitHub Copilot SDK to evaluate which documents from the knowledge base are most relevant to user questions, going beyond simple keyword matching
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Searches the local knowledge base before generating responses to provide more accurate, context-specific answers
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time streaming of responses via Server-Sent Events
- **Model Selection**: Uses GPT-4.1 for high-quality responses
- **Graceful Fallback**: Provides informative fallback responses if Copilot is unavailable

### Documentation Resources

- [GitHub Copilot SDK Documentation](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk)
- [Node.js Integration Guide](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/cookbook/copilot-sdk/nodejs/README.md)
- [Copilot SDK Cookbook](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/tree/main/cookbook/copilot-sdk)

### How It Works

1. **User Question**: User sends a question via the chat interface
2. **Initial Keyword Search**: The system performs a fast keyword search on the local `data/` directory to identify candidate documents
3. **Semantic Ranking**: GitHub Copilot SDK evaluates the candidates and ranks them by semantic relevance to the question
4. **Context Enhancement**: The most relevant document snippets are included as context
5. **Copilot Generation**: The GitHub Copilot SDK generates a response using the question and context
6. **Response Display**: The response is returned to the user (streamed or complete)

This two-stage approach combines the speed of keyword search with the semantic understanding of AI:
- **Stage 1**: Fast keyword filtering to narrow down candidates (handles typos, exact matches)
- **Stage 2**: Semantic ranking by Copilot SDK to select truly relevant documents (understands synonyms, intent, context)

The result is better document selection that can:
- Find documents even when different terminology is used
- Understand the intent behind questions
- Rank by true relevance rather than just keyword frequency

The main integration points are:
- `src/copilot-service.ts`: Wrapper for GitHub Copilot SDK with initialization, session management, and document ranking
- `src/knowledge-service.ts`: Implements both simple keyword search and Copilot-enhanced semantic search
- `src/server.ts`: API endpoints that combine knowledge base search with Copilot responses

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows that automatically run on every pull request:

### Lint and Build Workflow (`.github/workflows/lint-and-build.yml`)

- **Linting**: Ensures code quality and TypeScript standards
- **Building**: Verifies the application compiles successfully
- **Testing**: Runs the unit test suite (uses mocks, no authentication required)
- **Multi-version**: Tests against Node.js 18.x and 20.x

### Integration Test Workflow (`.github/workflows/integration-test.yml`)

Runs integration tests with the real GitHub Copilot SDK to verify end-to-end functionality.

**Requirements:**
- Node.js 24.x or later (required by `@github/copilot-sdk@0.1.23`)
- Tests against Node.js 24.x in CI

**Required Setup:**

To enable integration testing in GitHub Actions, you must configure a GitHub secret:

1. **Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
   - Go to GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Fine-grained tokens
   - Click "Generate new token"
   - Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Copilot Integration Tests")
   - Select your repository under "Repository access"
   - Under "Permissions" → "Account permissions", add **"Copilot Requests: Read"**
   - Generate and copy the token

2. **Add the token as a repository secret**:
   - Go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `COPILOT_TOKEN`
   - Value: Paste the PAT you created
   - Click "Add secret"

The integration test workflow will use this token to authenticate with the GitHub Copilot SDK.
