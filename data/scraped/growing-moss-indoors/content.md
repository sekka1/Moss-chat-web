## Method 1: Creating a Live Moss Terrarium

### 1. Purchase a large, transparent container or a terrarium

These can be glass or clear plastic containers. Just make sure that they're wide and shallow, so you can easily reach into them to maintain your moss. Whatever container you choose, make sure it comes with a lid to store your moss in ideal conditions.

- Pick up a container at your local crafts or home improvement store or online
- Choose a size based on your budget, the amount of space in your home, and how much time you want to spend maintaining the garden
- The bigger the container, the more maintenance your moss garden will need
- Plant expert Rachel Guffey recommends "buying a container that will close to trap humidity, such as a glass cloche"

### 2. Collect the moss from areas around your home

Find live moss on stumps, logs, soil, or rocks in upland areas. While wearing gloves, gently peel it from its base and put it in a clear container to transport it back home. Since moss grows in many places, try not to take all the moss from one patch. Twigs covered in moss also work well for this project.

- Always ask permission from the correct authorities if you plan on collecting moss from public land or property
- To make sure you collect enough moss to cover the base of your terrarium, bring your chosen container with you to get an accurate measurement
- You can buy moss online or at a floral shop if none grows near where you live
- However, preserved moss is often dry, which means it can be difficult to work with
- If you do want to buy moss, make sure you go for a fresh, living moss

### 3. Wash and sterilize the moss, if desired

If you plan on including other plants or small animals in your terrarium, sterilize the moss first to avoid bringing in bugs or harmful materials. Soak the moss in distilled water so the dirt and other materials loosen. Then, transfer the moss to another container of clean distilled water. Repeat the process until the water runs clear or mostly clear to ensure your moss is clean.

- If you're only growing moss in your terrarium, feel free to skip this step
- This step is also only necessary if you gathered your moss from the outdoors
- It shouldn't need to be sterilized if you purchased it

### 4. Line the bottom of the moss garden with pebbles to create a base

The base only needs to be one pebble deep (around 1 in or 2.5 cm), so only add one layer. For many moss species, saturated sand also makes a good base. Colorful and differently-shaped rocks can enhance the aesthetics of your moss garden, so be as creative as you want.

- Scavenge for pebbles near your home or pick some up at a local landscaping or home improvement store
- Buy saturated sand at your local hardware store or order some online
- If you are going to put forest mosses in your garden, avoid using potting soil as a base
- Guffey says peat moss is a great base for your moss

### 5. Top the pebbles with 1 in (2.5 cm) of granulated charcoal

While adding charcoal isn't necessary, it often helps the moss grow and establish better than moss gardens without it. Charcoal also helps filter toxins and odors that may build up in the terrarium.

- Not all moss species need charcoal to thrive, however
- For example, the New Zealand Sphagnum doesn't need it, but many forest types grow better with even a little bit of charcoal
- Find granulated charcoal online or in fish supply stores

### 6. Add 2 in (5 cm) of potting soil or other potting media

Spread the potting media evenly over the charcoal. In general, moss will grow on almost any potting media. Some species grow faster on natural materials like pine needles or rotten bark, though quick-draining potting soil also works. For best results, avoid potting soils with added fertilizers.

- If you use a potting mix, try a mix that's at least 50% rock (perlite, pumice, etc.) so that the soil drains quickly and absorbs moisture

### 7. Place large sheets of moss over the base

Arrange the moss directly on top of the stones and bark you've already set in place. Layer the moss so that every bit of the base is covered and press it down firmly. If there are still gaps after you've arranged all the sheets of moss, fill the empty spaces with crumbled moss flakes.

- When viewing your moss garden from above, only the moss should be visible, not the rocks or bark below it
- To keep the sheets of moss in place, put toothpicks every 5 inches (13 cm) along the outer part of the moss garden
- This will help prevent disturbances that could disrupt the moss's development

### 8. Mist the moss garden with distilled or purified water

Fill a spray bottle with distilled or purified water—avoid using plain tap water—and mist the moss until it's well saturated. Always mist the moss rather than watering it directly, as over-watering will stunt its growth. The moss should feel moist, but according to Guffey, there should be no "standing water in your base layer."

- Get distilled water at local home improvement stores or buy some online
- Rainwater also works well
- If the moss dries out, it could die, so make sure to mist thoroughly

### 9. Put the lid on the container and store it away from sunlight

Placing the lid on your terrarium will keep the environment moist and at a proper level of humidity. Then, store the moss garden away from direct sunlight, as too much sunlight could cause the moss to dry up. Opt for an area with decent air circulation and a nearby light source.

- Keep it near a slightly-cracked window in a well-lit room
- Moisture from the moss will evaporate in the slightly higher temperature created by the closed lid
- The water vapor condenses on the container's walls and falls back to the moss below, creating a cyclical supply of water for the moss
- Since the moisture is consistently recycled back to the moss, your garden only needs minimal care
- At least once a month, take the lids off the containers for 10-20 minutes to let your moss air out
- If you're going to put a lamp next to your moss garden to give it light, make sure the lamp isn't right over top of the container
- Too much exposure to light will hurt the moss
- A common mistake is to place the moss in a dark area under the assumption that this will keep the humidity high
- In fact, moss needs light to photosynthesize its nutrients, so don't make this mistake!

### 10. Spray the garden 2-3 times a day with distilled water

Using a spray bottle, lightly mist your moss multiple times a day to keep it damp and healthy. Make sure to close your containers immediately after spraying so the moss can keep reusing the water. Constantly check on your moss to see how it's doing.

- If your moss starts to fade or feels dry to the touch, Guffey says to "give the moss more light and frequent misting. See if it begins to green up again within a few days!"

## Method 2: Growing Moss from Spores

### 1. Buy or gather your moss spores

If you don't want to spend money on moss spores, pluck them off of untreated/sterilized peat moss. Moss spores typically resemble tiny shoots with caps on the end. Cut them with a pair of scissors and store them in a container to transport them home. Alternatively, buy moss spores online.

- It is possible to grow spores from other types of moss as well
- Peat moss is just common and generally easy to grow
- If you buy a specific type of moss spores, the package should give you instructions on how to grow them

### 2. Layer your moss garden in a pot with drainage holes

Creating a terrarium for moss spores works the same way as creating one for live moss, though using a container with drainage holes will help the spores get the moisture they need. Add a 1 in (2.5 cm) layer of rock material, 1 in (2.5 cm) of granulated charcoal, and 2 in (5 cm) of your preferred potting media.

### 3. Sprinkle the moss spores on top

In general, dust a ⅛-¼ in (0.3-0.6 cm) layer of moss spores on top of your substrate. Since moss doesn't have roots, the spores don't need to be buried. If you collected the spores from outside, feel free to add in other materials you may have collected in the process, like dead moss, rocks, or bark.

### 4. Set the pot in a shallow tray of water and cover

¼-½ in (0.6-1.3 cm) of water should be all you need. Then, cover the pot with a clear lid, cup, or bag. This ensures the moss spores get the amount of moisture and humidity they need to grow properly.

- For best results, use purified or distilled water
- Rainwater is also a great option

### 5. Set the pot under LED lights and check water levels weekly

Keep the moss spores out of direct sunlight, but ensure they have plenty of artificial light. As the spores grow, check the tray weekly to make sure it still has water and add more as necessary. If the surface is too dry, lightly sprinkle it with water.

### 6. After a few months, lower the humidity and water regularly

After the moss has been growing for a few months, offset the lid or add holes to it to slowly decrease the humidity. This is also the time to start watering the spores regularly, as the surface will dry out. When watering, poke a hole in the lid of a water bottle and sprinkle the water across the surface. Let the water drain, then repeat a few times to make sure the spores are properly hydrated.

### 7. Use the moss to seed other pots

After 1-6 months of consistent care, the moss should be grown. If you want to make more moss gardens, use tweezers to remove some moss from the pot and place them into another terrarium.

## Method 3: Types of Moss to Grow

### Peat moss / Sphagnum

Peat moss requires high humidity and pure water, and it typically grows easily in clear food containers (with lids) or in a terrarium or greenhouse. For best results, use LED lights and RO (reverse osmosis) water.

- Reverse osmosis is a water purification process that removes unwanted particles from water using a partially permeable membrane
- Peat moss usually grows in peat bogs, conifer forests, and moist tundra areas

### Purple / Fire moss

This is a common trailing moss that grows well in a wide range of conditions. It requires regular moisture and moderate light. For best results, leave a pot of purple or fire moss in a shallow tray of water so the potting media is always slightly damp.

- If you plan on growing other types of moss or plants, be aware that purple or fire moss is often considered an invasive species because of how quickly it grows and covers other types of moss
- Fire moss often grows in urban and industrial environments because of its high tolerance for pollution
- It may grow through cracks on the sidewalk or on old roofs

### Pincushion / White cushion moss

Pincushion moss is pillowy and grows well in moderate light and periods of dryness. It grows on a variety of substrates and thrives in dry environments as long as it is watered regularly.

- The presence of pincushion moss is often beneficial for Paphiopedilum slipper orchids
- Pincushion moss grows mainly in temperate forests across the northern hemisphere
